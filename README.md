# MyMarketPlace
This project was completed by three students from the fullstack development course IDATT2105 at NTNU.

The project itself entailed creating a marketplace website with functionalities that would enable users to list and sell their items.

Our solution was built using Vue for the frontend and Spring Boot Maven for the backend API calls.

For our frontend, we used a set of libraries and modules to enable ease of use.

####Some of the more important ones are:
Typescript for typescript support

Vue Router for defining routes
Pinia for state management
Vitest for unit testing components
Axios for api calls


###Back-end
Our backend runs on spring boot maven.
